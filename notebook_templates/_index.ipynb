HKLJ-classification is done manually with the help of YKL-classification, other cities classification, keywords, language and other knowledge of librarian. The aim of this student project project is to study and try how the machine learning algorithms might solve the problem. With the help of machine learning algorithms we try to find automatically HKLJ-classification for new library items."
